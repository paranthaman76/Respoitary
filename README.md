Title: Predict Air Quality Levels Using Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms for Environmental Insights


---

1. Problem Statement

Air pollution is one of the leading environmental risks to human health. Exposure to pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), benzene (C6H6), nitrogen oxides (NOx, NO2), and others significantly affects respiratory and cardiovascular health. Real-time and predictive monitoring of air quality can help cities take proactive steps in reducing harmful exposure.

This project focuses on a regression problem, where the goal is to predict pollutant concentrations based on environmental features like temperature and humidity. By building predictive models, we aim to uncover patterns in pollution levels and offer insights to support urban environmental planning and public health advisories.

2. Project Objectives

Predict air pollutant levels (CO, C6H6, NOx, NO2) using advanced regression algorithms.

Analyze how environmental factors (temperature, humidity) affect air quality.

Identify peak pollution times and trends for targeted action.

Achieve high accuracy and interpretability through model evaluation and feature importance.

Evolve the problem understanding through data exploration and visualization.

4. Data Description

Source: Kaggle - Air Quality Dataset

Type: Time-series, structured data

Records: ~9,000 hourly measurements (after cleaning)

Features: Date, Time, CO(GT), C6H6(GT), NOx(GT), NO2(GT), Temperature (T), Relative Humidity (RH)

Target Variables: CO, C6H6, NOx, NO2

Static or Dynamic: Static snapshot (2004–2005)



---

5. Data Preprocessing

Combined Date and Time into a unified DateTime column.

Replaced invalid/missing values (e.g., -200) with NaN and dropped them.

Selected and renamed relevant columns.

Aggregated data to daily averages to reduce noise and better observe trends.

Ensured consistent data types and formats for analysis.



---

6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate Analysis: Histograms and time-series plots for pollutants and environmental conditions.

Bivariate Analysis:

Scatter plot of NOx vs NO2 (high positive correlation).

CO and C6H6 plotted over time to identify trends.

Temperature and Humidity trends across seasons.


Key Insights:

Peak pollution during evenings (likely due to traffic).

Strong correlation between NOx and NO2.

Seasonal variations observed in temperature and pollutant levels.




---

7. Feature Engineering

Extracted day, month, and hour from DateTime (optional extension).

Aggregated hourly data to daily means to remove short-term fluctuations.

Standardized numeric features for algorithm compatibility.

Optionally derived interaction terms or pollutant ratios (for advanced modeling).



---

8. Model Building

Problem Type: Regression

Models Used:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor (for non-linearity and feature importance)

(Optionally add XGBoost or SVR for further improvement)


Training/Test Split: 80/20 split

Evaluation Metrics:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

R² Score (Goodness of Fit)


Justification: Random Forest provides good performance on structured datasets with missing values and non-linear trends.

9. Visualization of Results & Model Insights

Time-series plots of pollutants (CO and C6H6).

Scatter plot: NOx vs NO2 shows linear dependency.

Temperature vs Humidity Trends: Visualized via dual-axis plots.

Summary Table of pollutant levels for the first 10 days.

Model Insight (from feature importance):

Temperature and humidity significantly impact CO and benzene levels.

Traffic-related pollutants correlate with environmental patterns.
